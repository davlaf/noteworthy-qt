# Noteworthy QT

This is the frontend for a live slides annotation web app made for a group project in my software development methodology course. We wanted to make a web app, but the course required over 80% of the code to be in C++. To sidestep this limitation, our group decided to use QT with emscripten to create the frontend.

It is currently hosted at [noteworthy.howdoesthiseven.work](https://noteworthy.howdoesthiseven.work). Give it a try with two browser windows open or on two different devices! Not optimized for phones but does work on tablets.
